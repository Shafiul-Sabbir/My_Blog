If anyone is doing this tutorial and having troubles with crispy forms, with the help of tutorial and some comments, I found that this works:

1) pip install django_crispy_forms
2) pip install crispy_bootstrap5
3) Add both of these to INSTALLED_APPS:
    'crispy_forms',
    'crispy_bootstrap5',
4) Add both of these at the bottom:
CRISPY_ALLOWED_TEMPLATE_PACKS = "bootstrap5"

CRISPY_TEMPLATE_PACK = 'bootstrap5'
5) Use {% load crispy_forms_tags %} and {{ form|crispy }} in the html file.
